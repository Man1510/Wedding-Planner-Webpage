Wedding Planner Webpage - developed using HTML and CSS


The Wedding Planner System project has been developed using HTML and CSS, with the primary objective of creating a website that provides comprehensive wedding information to users. This website serves as a central hub for obtaining essential details pertaining to weddings, including wedding planners, venues, addresses, themes, contact information, and more. The project is designed as a static website, utilizing HTML and CSS, which allows for the creation of visually appealing page layouts. 

The project solely focuses on the front-end development, utilizing HTML and CSS exclusively, resulting in a static website that does not engage in dynamic database operations. This architectural choice enables efficient and lightweight page rendering, while maintaining the integrity and performance of the website.
